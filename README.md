# 🛡️ LicenseGuard

**LicenseGuard** is a software licensing protection system designed to defend commercial applications from unauthorized activation tools, such as KMS emulators (e.g., KMSPico), cracks, and keygens. It helps developers enforce license integrity and prevent abuse.

## 🎯 Project Goal

Create a tool that:

- Protects license keys and activation data from tampering or spoofing
- Detects and blocks known activation bypass tools
- Verifies license authenticity via secure API calls
- Automates license validation without user intervention
- Supports flexible licensing logic (online + offline)

---

## 🔐 Key Features

- ✅ License file encryption and digital signature verification
- ✅ Protection against service spoofing and file substitution
- ✅ Server-based license validation (with HWID binding)
- ✅ AES-256 local encryption for license storage
- ✅ KMS and emulator detection
- ✅ Developer alerts on suspicious activity
- 🧩 Plugin-based architecture (coming soon)

## 🧱 Tech Stack

| Purpose                    | Tools / Technologies              |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Client implementation     | C++, Rust, C# (.NET)              |
| License verification API  | FastAPI (Python) / Node.js        |
| License data storage      | SQLite / PostgreSQL               |
| Encryption algorithms     | AES-256, RSA, HMAC                |
| Anti-debug / Anti-crack   | WMI, ETW, anti-debugging methods  |

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. On application startup, the local license is checked.
2. Signature and integrity are verified.
3. An optional request is made to the API to verify license and hardware ID.
4. Known activation bypass tools are detected.
5. LicenseGuard blocks execution and reports activity if tampering is detected.

## 🚫 What LicenseGuard Does NOT Do

- ❌ It does not alter or disable core Windows services
- ❌ It does not spy on the user or collect private data
- ❌ It does not use aggressive or intrusive methods
- ❌ It does not break your software functionality
